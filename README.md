        <h1>Navneet, Anmol, and Sanoj's School Meetup</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a vibrant and bustling 4th-grade classroom, three friends named <span class="highlight">Navneet</span>, <span class="highlight">Anmol</span>, and <span class="highlight">Sanoj</span> were eagerly awaiting their school day.</p>
        <p>It was a sunny Monday morning, and the excitement in the air was palpable. Navneet, known for his bright smile and curious nature, was the first to arrive. He quickly took his seat by the window, where he loved to watch the birds outside during break time.</p>
        <p>Shortly after, Anmol, with his infectious enthusiasm and love for storytelling, walked into the classroom. He greeted Navneet with a high-five and started recounting the weekend adventure he had with his family. His stories were always full of imagination and wonder.</p>
        <p>Just as the bell rang, Sanoj, the most meticulous of the group, entered the room carrying a neatly packed bag and a book he was eager to share. Sanoj was always known for his attention to detail and his love for reading. The trio quickly gathered around their desks, sharing laughs and planning their day together.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, Navneet, Anmol, and Sanoj enjoyed their lessons and activities. They were always there for each other, helping with schoolwork and sharing their dreams. Their friendship made every school day an adventure, filled with learning, laughter, and camaraderie.</p>
        <p>As the school day came to an end, the friends promised to meet again the next day, eager to continue their fun and adventures in the 4th grade.</p>
